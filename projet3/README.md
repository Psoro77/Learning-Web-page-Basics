# 🌸 Online Flower Shop

Welcome to the **Online Flower Shop**

This project is a simple but complete Online Flower Shop web application built with PHP. It lets users browse different types of flowers (like tulips, roses, orchids, peonies, and dahlias), view product details, and add items to their shopping cart.

The goal of the project was to simulate a real e-commerce experience with product pages, shopping cart management, user-friendly navigation, and clean design. It’s designed to be responsive and easy to use for customers.

Each flower has its own dedicated page, complete with:

A photo

A description

A price

Ratings and similar product suggestions

The project includes reusable components like the navbar, footer, and success messages to keep the code modular and organized.
